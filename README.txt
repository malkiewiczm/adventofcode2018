Advent of Code 2018

I did most of these in C++ but there is some javascript.

Most require a file called "in.txt" for the input, but some take the 
file name through their command line args, I was a bit inconsistent.

The output files are always .exe, even on linux. I did this because it 
made the makefile a bit cleaner.

Example: compile and run day 25 with

$ make 25
$ ./25.exe
